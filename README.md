# Project-1---Mental-Health-in-Tech

Data Source:

Our data set are the survey results from OSMH surveys taken between 2017 and 2021
https://osmhhelp.org/research.html

Project Questions:

1. Observing trends by demographics
A) What correlations can be found between demographics (gender, age) and awareness of mental healthcare benefits?
B) What correlations can be found between country and mental health benefits provided by employer?

2. Observing trends by industry
A) Are tech employees more likely than non-tech employees to have a mental health condition?
B) Are tech companies more likely than non-tech companies to offer mental health benefits?

3. Observing trends before and after pandemic
A) How much importance did employers place on mental health before and after the pandemic?
B) How comfortable did employees feel discussing mental health with their direct supervisor(s) before and after the pandemic?

Totals were obtained for each response by year and plotted onto bar charts for visual comparison.

For question 3a, since the responses were numerical, the mean responses were calculated and an individual t-test was performed. A statistical analysis could not be performed for question 3b since the responses were non-numerical.

Results: 
3a) Analysis result: Although the mean response is higher in 2021 (2.67) compared to 2018 (2.53), it is not statistically significant (p-value=.16).
3b) A higher percentage of employees answered "No" in 2021 than 2018.
